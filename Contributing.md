## TODO
- Add JSON style setup
- Add a GUI with adjustable message and delay
- Add support for multiple messages and a "smart" footer so that messages don't look squashed together
- Remove the capability for spamming by capping the minimal delay time (This would also remove its capability as a captioner)
